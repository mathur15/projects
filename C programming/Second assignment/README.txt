Collecting various contents from directories through the use of different processes makes it difficult to detect hard links. The reason this design is difficult is because there is no communication between the processes and hence making it hard to detect if there are any. However, in order to do this, various processes will need to be running simultaneously while communicating between in order in order to check for any duplicate files. This design would become really tedious and inefficient.ss
